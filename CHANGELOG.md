## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0a1] - 2026-10-15

Second alpha release (stage 2: verification in depth).

### Added

- `handoverlab verify` command and `handoverlab.verify.run_verify()`: check groups `pathloss`
  (TR 38.901 against hand values), `radio` (radio statistics against the model parameters),
  `invariants`, `equivalences` and `fingerprints`; `--full`, `--only`, `--json`; `--ns3` for the
  reference comparison with stored ns-3 / 5G-LENA results; `--results FILE [--sample N]` to
  recompute stored runs and compare event-log fingerprints and metrics.
- Debug mode of the engine (`debug=True`, `handoverlab run --debug`, `HANDOVERLAB_DEBUG=1`) with
  invariant checks at every step, validation of the values returned by rules and a read-only
  observation; `InvariantError`.
- More conservation checks at the end of every run: every attempt gets exactly one outcome, and
  every preparation ends as lost, cancelled, used, unused or open (also across the warm-up).
- Event-log fingerprints (`handoverlab.eventlog`): SHA-256 of a canonical CSV form, computed for
  every run (`RunResult.fingerprint`, `n_events`) and stored in CSV and JSON results together with
  the rule key.
- Event logs as tables: `write_events` (Parquet with `pyarrow`, else CSV; extra `parquet`),
  `read_events`, typed column catalogue `EVENT_COLUMNS`; `run --events` accepts `.parquet`.
- Golden event-log fingerprints of eight short reference runs (`handoverlab/verify/data/golden.json`,
  regenerated with `python -m handoverlab.verify.golden --write`).
- Contract test kit for rule plug-ins: `handoverlab.testing.check_rule` and the example plug-in
  `ScaledA3`.
- Built-in scenarios with scenario cards (`smoke`, `urban-grid-10ghz`, `open-area-10ghz`,
  `ns3-urban-3.5ghz`): YAML cards in the package, Markdown pages and layout drawings in
  `docs/scenarios`, `handoverlab scenarios`, `builtin_scenario()`, `scenario: NAME` and
  `scenario: {base: NAME, ...}` in configuration files.
- Protocol switch `cfg_loss_as_failure` (check mode) for the equivalence "CHO with immediate
  execution = A3".
- Reference data of an ns-3 / 5G-LENA study (24 A3 settings, four conditions) with acceptance
  limits; result of this version: median ratios 0.95 (handovers) and 1.04 (unnecessary handovers),
  rank correlation 0.99 for both.
- Wider regression sample against the bh6 prototype (eight more cases with four rules each,
  metrics and event logs).
- Documentation: verification and performance pages, user-guide sections on scenarios, event logs,
  verification, debug mode and the contract kit.

### Changed

- The world build is about a third faster (path loss, LOS state, random fields, line of sight);
  results are bit-identical.
- The engine always keeps its event log internally to compute the fingerprint; `RunResult.events`
  is still set only when requested. Event-log values are plain Python numbers.
- Result CSV files have the new columns `fingerprint` and `n_events`; JSON records also hold `key`.

## [0.1.0a1] - 2026-10-15

First alpha release (stage 1: the core simulator).

### Added

- `handoverlab` package (src layout, Python 3.9 or later; NumPy, SciPy, PyYAML).
- Scenarios: TR 37.885 urban street grid with a configurable number of blocks (default 3 x 3),
  open area with a hexagonal site grid, explicit site lists.
- Channel: TR 38.901 UMi street canyon and UMa path loss and LOS probability; building line of
  sight plus the spatially consistent LOS state; place-tied correlated shadowing with an optional
  share that moves with the user; time-varying component; L1 measurement error; beam gain and
  load-coupled interference.
- Mobility: street-following users with turn probabilities, random waypoints, speed profiles and
  user-defined speed groups.
- Measurement chain: L1 samples, TS 38.331 L3 filter, Event A3 with time-to-trigger, periodic
  reporting.
- Handover procedures: baseline handover and Rel-16 conditional handover (up to 8 prepared cells),
  with a radio-link failure model (Qout/Qin, N310/N311/T310, re-establishment, CHO recovery).
- Rule interface (`BaselineRule`, `ConditionalRule`) with a registry, a decorator and the
  `handoverlab.rules` entry-point group; built-in rules `a3` and `cho`.
- Outcome label for every attempt, failures by cause, preparation, interruption and service
  metrics; conservation checks at the end of every run.
- Configuration as YAML, TOML, JSON or dictionary, with key-level validation messages.
- Command line `handoverlab run | rules | init`, CSV and JSON result files, event-log export.
- Tests: path loss, L3 filter, A3 and CHO triggers, failure model, configuration, command line,
  determinism, and a regression test against the bh6 prototype on a 2 x 2-block grid.
- Documentation: README, user guide, contribution guide, citation file; CI on Linux, Windows and
  macOS with Python 3.9-3.12.
